# vimstuff

My .vimrc settings.

This may or may not be portable between all of my environments (*nix, win, osx).  It _should_ be for the major stuff.

For most things to work on a new install, don't forget to go install vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

Download plug.vim and put it in the "autoload" directory (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#installation).

Proceed as usual.
